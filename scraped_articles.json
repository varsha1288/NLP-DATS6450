{"newspapers": {"cnn_Josh Hawley": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/politics/cnn-polls-missouri-nevada-senate/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/09/politics/cnn-key-races-senate-update-early-september/index.html", "published": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive", "text": "In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.\n\nAs a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.\n\nFor many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.\n\nThe American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.\n\nSeizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.\n\nEven Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.\n\nIn Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.\n\nBut a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.\n\nWhat Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.\n\nIf they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Nerve,\" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. \"He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\"\n\nAnd this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \"goes to camera\" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018\n\nIn a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Bill Nelson": {"link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-andrew-gillum-bill-nelson-cnn-poll-20181022-story.html", "articles": [{"title": "Hear new episodes of the true-crime podcast Felonious Florida now", "text": "A stunning triple murder, a killer clown and mysterious text messages from a missing woman.\n\nThe hit podcast Felonious Florida is back with a second season featuring three new stories from the Dark Side of the Sunshine State.\n\nIn Episodes 1 and 2 released today, investigative reporter Stephen Hobbs follows the case of a brutal 2009 triple murder.\n\nThe sole survivor had been shot in the head, and her inconsistent memories of the ordeal were making it difficult for detectives to find a suspect.

The numbers may not be as good as advertised for Democrats Gillum and Nelson or as bad for Republicans Ron DeSantis or Rick Scott.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, the CNN poll conducted Tuesday through Saturday shows Gillum with support from 54 percent of likely voters to 42 percent for DeSantis. That\u2019s a 12 percentage point advantage for Gillum.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, CNN has Nelson leading Scott among likely voters, 50 percent to 45 percent. That\u2019s a Nelson lead of 5 points.\n\nCNN has the famous brand name, but its poll might be overstating support for the Democratic candidates and understating support for the Republicans.\n\nAnother survey, from SEA Polling & Strategic Design, which generally polls for Democrats, found closer contests.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, SEA found 48 percent for Gillum to 42 percent for DeSantis among registered voters.\n\nIn the Senate race, SEA found Scott leading Nelson, 47 percent to 45 percent among registered voters.\n\nThe poll from SEA was conducted from Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nGillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, is currently the mayor of Tallahassee. Republican DeSantis was serving his third term as a member of Congress from northeast Florida until he resigned last month to campaign full time.\n\nThe candidates met for their first debate Sunday night.\n\nDemocrat Nelson is seeking a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. Republican Gov. Rick Scott can\u2019t run for a third term as governor because of term limits, so he is running against nelson.\n\nAmong the reasons to be cautious about the CNN numbers:\n\n-- Trump response \u2014 The CNN survey found more Florida voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (42 percent) of President Donald Trump\u2019s performance, a net negative of 8 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Virtually every public opinion poll shows more disapproval than approval for the president.\n\nWhat is unusual is the comparison to the national average. RealClearPolitics reports the average of national polls shows 52 percent disapproval and 44 percent approval of Trump, a net negative of 8 points.\n\nThat\u2019s strikingly similar to the percentages CNN reported in Florida. Throughout his presidency, Trump has had notably higher favorable percentages and lower unfavorable percentages in Florida than the nation.\n\n-- Hurricane Michael \u2014 The disruptions in electricity and phone service caused by the hurricane in the Panhandle \u2013 strong Republican territory \u2014 might change the composition of the people polled. It\u2019s impossible to know how many Panhandle voters won\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s election.\n\n-- Methodology. The CNN survey asked people to describe their affiliations, with 32 percent Democrats, 29 percent Republican, and 39 percent independent.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign said the methodology of the poll is seriously flawed, which \u201crenders the finding useless.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the sample \u201chas more Independent voters than Democrats or Republicans and more Democrats than Republicans. However, in the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 general elections more Republicans voted than Democrats or Independents.\u201d\n\nStephen Lawson, a DeSantis spokesman, said in a written statement that the poll shows \u201cwhy so many Americans believe that CNN peddles fake news.\u201d\n\nCNN said its mix of Democrats, Republicans and voters who have no party affiliation or are members of a third party \u201calmost exactly matches\u201d the state\u2019s registered voters.\n\n-- Outlier. Some polls are considered \u201coutliers\u201d by political professionals, meaning that for a variety of reasons they don\u2019t get a good sample and the conclusions raise skepticism. Some political analysts have suggested the CNN poll might be an outlier.\n\nUntil the CNN poll released Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average had Gillum and DeSantis just 1 percentage point apart, with 45.3 percent for Gillum and 44.3 percent for DeSantis. Without CNN, the RealClearPolitics average in the Senate race had Scott and Nelson tied at 46.3 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there\u2019s been a big recent surge toward Gillum and Nelson, or the CNN poll could be an outlier.\n\nThe cable network acknowledged those possibilities in an article it published Monday about the poll. \u201cThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance. It also could be an indicator of renewed Democratic enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThe fine print\n\nIn the CNN poll, the research company SSRS used live callers to reach 769 likely voters by phone from Tuesday through Saturday.

Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum holds a wide 12-point edge over his Republican opponent Rep. Ron DeSantis in the race for governor, while the Senate contest is a closer matchup with incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson at 50% to Republican Gov. Rick Scott's 45%.\n\nGillum's 54% to 42% lead rests on advantages among women (60% back him vs. 34% who say they favor DeSantis), non-white voters (74% back Gillum, 23% DeSantis), younger voters (60% for Gillum, 33% for DeSantis) and political independents (51% back Gillum, 42% DeSantis). Gillum has also consolidated Democratic support (97% favor him) in a way that DeSantis has not matched on the Republican side (88% back him).\n\nViews of Donald Trump are about as polarizing as partisanship in this race, which Trump has tweeted about multiple times. Among the 51% of likely voters who disapprove of the president, 92% back Gillum, while 87% back DeSantis among the 43% who approve of Trump.\n\nThe poll shows a wider lead for Gillum than some other recent telephone polling, nearly all of which was conducted before Hurricane Michael struck the state on October 10. Before the storm, public polling in mid- to late-September on these contests was mixed, with some (including surveys from Mason-Dixon and the University of North Florida) finding near-even races while others (including the Quinnipiac University and NBC News/Marist polls) gave the Democratic candidates the edge.\n\nThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance.

She described agreement on this as \u201ccritical\u201d.\n\nOn the idea of extending the transition period, May said: \u201cI have not committed to extending the implementation period, I do not want to extent the implementation period, and I do not believe that extending it will be necessary.\u201d\n\nThe third element laid out by the prime minister would be a guarantee that neither a backstop or the transition period could be indefinite; and the fourth would be a further commitment on full continued access for Northern Irish businesses to the rest of the UK.\n\nThe prime minister urged MPs to think of the wider national interest. \u201cWhen I stood in Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time, I pledged that the government I lead will not be driven by the interests of the privileged few but of ordinary working families,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd, if doing those things means I get difficult days in Brussels, then so be it. The Brexit talks are not about my interests, they are about the national interest and the interests of the whole of our United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cServing our national interest will demand that we hold our nerve through these last stages of the negotiations, the hardest part of all.\u201d\n\nIt would also \u201cmean focusing on the prize that lies before us: the great opportunities that we can open up for our country when we clear these final hurdles in the negotiations,\u201d May said.\n\nHowever, immediately before May spoke another potential issue flared up as a series of Conservative MPs complained about limitations on how a Commons motion on a final Brexit deal could be amended.\n\nAnswering an urgent question from the leading Tory remainer Dominic Grieve, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, confirmed that while a motion would be amendable, this could not mean delaying departure or altering the final deal \u2013 in effect giving MPs a choice between the deal as presented or a no-deal departure.\n\nGrieve called this \u201centirely unsatisfactory\u201d and was backed up by Tories including Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry.\n\nBut in one boon for May, the leading Brexiter and former minister Steve Baker withdrew an amendment to the Northern Ireland bill, to be debated next week, which could have ended up blocking the backstop by requiring any such plan to be endorsed by the Stormont assembly, which has not sat since 2017.\n\nIn a tweet, Baker said he had withdrawn the amendments as it \u201cwould not be in the public interest\u201d to push ahead with them."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/22/special-needs-pupils-being-failed-by-system-on-verge-crisis", "published": "2018-10-22T13:00:07", "title": "Special needs pupils being failed by system 'on verge of crisis'", "text": "Children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are being failed by a system \u201con the verge of crisis\u201d as demand for specialist support soars and threatens to bankrupt local authorities, a Guardian investigation has revealed.\n\nParents of children with SEND are increasingly locked in prolonged and costly disputes with councils across England who are too often failing to deliver on their legal obligations.\n\nAs a result, many of the most vulnerable children in society end up without the support to which they are entitled, and are out of school for months \u2013 even years \u2013 as parents battle to secure the right provision to meet their child\u2019s needs.\n\nAppeals heard by the special educational needs and disability tribunal have nearly doubled in the past two years. According to the most recent figures, parents are successful in 89% of tribunal hearings, prompting concerns that some local authorities are making poor decisions, delaying vulnerable children\u2019s access to education.\n\nBetween 2011-12 and 2015-16, the tribunal heard about 800 cases a year; in 2016-17 the number rose to 1,600 in the fallout after sweeping government changes for children with SEN and disabilities that came into force in 2014.\n\nAli Fiddy, the chief executive of Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA), which offers advice and support for parents, said there had been a 56% increase in demand for IPSEA\u2019s services since the Children and Families Act 2014 which they were struggling to meet.\n\n\u201cThe system for supporting children and young people with SEND is verging on crisis. Against a backdrop of increasing cuts to local authority budgets, parents are having to deal with poor decision making on the part of local authorities which frequently stems from a lack of understanding of the legal framework.\u201d\n\nFindings by the local government and social care ombudsman, who investigates complaints about local public services, confirm worrying levels of council failure within the SEND system. Out of 200 investigations into parents\u2019 complaints, the ombudsman, Michael King, found in favour of parents in eight out of 10 cases.\n\nSpecial needs: 'It's soul-destroying to have to watch your daughter get worse\u2019 Read more\n\nOne family had to go to tribunal twice and the ombudsman on three separate occasions to fight for the right provision for their 11-year-old son. \u201cAs a family it has a huge cost, both emotionally and financially. They failed him consistently for three years,\u201d the mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s left me feeling quite bruised and scared that the people who are supposed to be looking out for children are not.\u201d\n\nKing said: \u201cWhile our investigations can only provide part of the picture of how the SEN system is functioning \u2013 that picture is causing concern. The reality is that some families are suffering a disproportionate burden in having to battle for the support their children are entitled to.\u201d\n\nMore than 1.2 million school pupils \u2013 about 15% of all those in England \u2013 have some kind of SEND, according to the Department for Education. Approximately 253,000 (3% of all pupils) have SEND statements or education and health care plans (EHCP), a legally binding document detailing the additional support that child needs.\n\nCouncils, suffering from years of budget cuts, warn the current system is \u201cunsustainable\u201d. The Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services (ADCS) said 68 out of 85 local authorities who responded to a survey reported an overspend on their high needs budget in 2016-17 totalling \u00a3139.5m.\n\nThe SEND crisis is also being felt in schools that are already grappling with an 8% real-terms reduction in funding since 2010, resulting in cuts to teaching assistants, specialist support and pastoral staff who play a vital role in supporting SEN pupils in mainstream settings.\n\nIn Kent, which is one of the biggest local authorities in England, high-needs spending rose from \u00a3119m five years ago to \u00a3167m this year. In the last 18 months there has been an 81% increase in requests for EHCP assessments. Part of the national increase in demand is due to the fact that the government\u2019s SEND changes extended council liability to the age of 25.\n\nMatt Dunkley, the director of children\u2019s services in Kent, said: \u201cI understand parents\u2019 frustration on this \u2013 the 2014 legislation set out an expectation of what they are entitled to, but we have a system that is not currently funded sufficiently to meet their demands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crisis that threatens to undermine the general funding of schools, but also potentially to bankrupt local authorities who might have to bail out overspend from their own resources. We\u2019ve got a perfect storm which is contriving to threaten the viability of the system.\u201d\n\nAs mainstream schools struggle to support SEND pupils, a drift towards specialist schools \u2013 in particularly independent specialist schools \u2013 is an additional financial burden for councils. Official statistics show the number of children in private schools has risen from 3.7% of all SEND children in England to 6.9% in the last 10 years. Costs can be upwards of \u00a350,000 a year per child; in a few extreme and complex cases it can cost \u00a3500,000 a year.\n\nThe House of Commons education select committee will meet this week to hear evidence as part of an inquiry into SEND. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThere are rising concerns about the quality and access to SEN provision, including the impact of funding issues and the very real difficulties parents face in securing help for their children.\u201d\n\nCouncils around the country are consulting on proposals to cut SEND spending, while parents are crowdfunding to fight cuts in the courts. In August, families in Bristol forced the city council to reverse \u00a35m of SEND cuts, parents in Surrey are awaiting judgment in a similar legal action to stop \u00a322m of cuts, and parents in the London borough of Hackney are in the high court next week.\n\nOn the ground, parents say their children are losing home-to-school transport, speech therapy and one-to-one support as budget cuts bite. A petition signed by tens of thousands of parents calling for increased SEND funding is due to be handed to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, on Tuesday.\n\nFamilies have also crowdfunded more than \u00a310,000 to bring legal action against Hinds, as well as the chancellor, Philip Hammond. A \u201cletter before claim\u201d has been delivered accusing them of \u201cfailing to discharge their legal duties relating to the amount of funding allocated to SEND provision in England\u201d.\n\nJo-Anne Sanders, the director of learning and early support at Kirklees, apologised for the council\u2019s failings and said an additional \u00a3500,000 was being allocated to the SEND budget because of the pressure on resources.\n\n\u201cThe council has acknowledged the findings of the ombudsman and we also accept that we failed to make sure the child in question received the support they were entitled to for a significant period of time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe council has been working closely with parents, listening to their concerns and developing ways in which we can improve our services for children and families. We remain committed to making sure that all children are able to achieve the best possible start in life.\u201d\n\nThe shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe situation facing the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children is so serious that the United Nations has warned that Britain is violating the international rights of disabled people, and thousands of disabled young people have been left without a school place at all.\u201d\n\nThe minister for children and families, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cCore schools funding is increasing to \u00a343.5bn by 2020 \u2013 this includes \u00a36bn of funding specifically for children with special educational needs and disabilities, up from \u00a35bn in 2013.\n\n\u201cBut we recognise there are pressures on high-needs budgets due to increasing costs, which is why we have taken a number of steps to help schools and local authorities get the best value for every pound.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/22/cctv-footage-appears-to-show-jamal-khashoggi-body-double-in-istanbul", "published": "2018-10-22T15:37:45", "title": "CCTV footage appears to show Khashoggi body double in Istanbul", "text": "CNN publishes footage of man wearing clothes of journalist, who was killed at consulate earlier this month\n\nNewly leaked CCTV footage has emerged that appears to show a Saudi agent leaving the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul wearing the clothes of the murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCNN aired the footage on Monday, citing a Turkish official who identified the man as Mustafa al-Madani, a \u201cbody double\u201d and member of a 15-man Saudi team sent to Istanbul to target Khashoggi.\n\nThe agent, wearing glasses and a fake beard in an apparent attempt to further resemble the journalist, is seen touring a number of landmarks in the Turkish city after leaving the consulate.\n\nThe apparent Saudi aim was for footage of the man to be picked up by CCTV and distributed, thereby bolstering its claims made in the days after Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance on 2 October that he had left the consulate unscathed.\n\nLate on Friday, after weeks of denials, the Saudis admitted for the first time that Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been killed after entering the consulate to organise paperwork for his marriage. His fiancee had been waiting for him at the front of the building.\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has said details of the Washington Post journalist\u2019s killing \u201cwill be revealed in all its nakedness\u201d in parliament on Tuesday, the same day a glitzy investment forum in Riyadh spearheaded by the crown prince is to take place.\n\nThe spokesman for Turkey\u2019s ruling AK party on Monday said it was Turkey\u2019s responsibility to uncover the truth, telling reporters it was a \u201ccomplicated\u201d murder that had been \u201cmonstrously planned\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia has never produced any CCTV footage of the body double to support its initial claim Khashoggi had left the consulate alive, and either Saudi officials realised the story would not be credible or had been hoping Turkish officials to be tricked by the ruse.\n\nThe footage was handed to the CNN news channel by Turkish authorities.\n\nThe CCTV leak of the apparent use of a body double is significant because it appears to bolster Turkish claims that the Saudis always intended either to kill Khashoggi or move him back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe footage appears to show the Saudi agent entering the consulate without a beard and wearing a blue and white checked shirt and dark blue trousers. Footage from later in the day appears to show him leaving the consulate dressed as Khashoggi, but wearing the same pair of trainers that he had arrived in.\n\nThe man walks out of the consulate via its back exit with an accomplice, then takes a taxi to Istanbul\u2019s famed Blue Mosque, where he goes to a public bathroom, changes back out of the clothes and leaves.

Other consulate vehicles were searched last week, along with the consulate building and the consul general\u2019s residence.\n\nSurveillance video aired by the Turkish state broadcaster TRT showed what Turkish security officials described as suspicious movement in the carpark, including an image of a man moving a bag from one vehicle to another.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police officers block the road after a vehicle belonging to Saudi consulate in Istanbul was found at a car park area in the Sultangazi district.

The Turkish newspaper claim is not substantiated, but previous leaks to Turkish press by Turkish government sources have proved accurate.\n\nThe phone call claim takes responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder closer to the office of the crown prince, though the content of the calls are not known.

There was no extradition arrangement for an offence of this nature, he said, so there might be no charges unless the man handed himself over to the Spanish authorities. \u201cI doubt whether he\u2019s going to do that,\u201d Turner said.\n\nRyanair tweeted on Sunday that it had reported the matter to Essex police. \u201cAs this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.\u201d"}]}, "breitbart": {"link": "http://www.breitbart.com/", "articles": [{"title": "Migrant Caravan Grows to 7,000, Trump Vows to Slash Central American Aid", "text": "President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the United States would begin \u201ccutting off, or substantially reducing\u201d foreign aid to Central America over a growing migrant caravan marching toward the southern border.\n\n\u201cGuatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.,\u201d President Trump tweeted. \u201cWe will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\u201d\n\nGuatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them. \u2014 Donald J.

(Nicolas Liponne/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s been another busy month for China\u2019s anti-corruption authorities.\n\nThere was the head of Interpol, who was unceremoniously seized during a trip to Beijing. There was the state bank executive who was caught hiding tons \u2014 literally \u2014 of ill-gotten cash in his moldy basement.\n\nThere was the disgraced general who was purged by the Communist Party as punishment even after he had hanged himself.\n\nArrests, disappearances, investigations, posthumous humiliations: The stream of eye-catching headlines coming out of Beijing in October is a reminder that President Xi Jinping\u2019s hallmark anti-corruption drive is showing few signs of letting up in its sixth year.\n\nChasing suspected fraudsters, influence peddlers and others remains popular with the public. But Xi\u2019s campaign also shows other tumult within the upper ranks of China\u2019s leadership, business world and security apparatus.\n\nLeaders are grappling with internal upheavals at a time when Beijing is juggling mounting challenges, from trade frictions with Washington to economic stress at home.\n\nDespite rounds of purges in recent years, \u201cone serious problem that Xi Jinping faces is that the administration is still actually poorly run,\u201d said Willy Lam, who studies Chinese politics at Hong Kong University. \u201cThey should have their house in order by now, but they don\u2019t. That could affect China\u2019s ability to carry out policy or fight the trade war with the U.S.\u201d\n\n[Opinion: Interpol chief arrest shows world it\u2019s no longer business as usual]\n\nThe numbers are staggering. Since Xi started the push in 2012, authorities have investigated more than 2.7 million officials and punished more than 1.5 million people. They include seven national-level leaders and two dozen high-ranking generals. Prosecutors have tried about 58,000 officials and sentenced two to death.\n\nAmong the latest officials to face prosecution is Lai Xiaomin, the former head of state-owned bank Huarong Asset Management and a onetime central bank official.\n\nLai was expelled from the party last week after he was found in \u201cserious violation\u201d of party law and regulations. According to the financial website Caixin, Lai took bribes, flouted government financial policy \u2014 and hid three metric tons of tainted cash worth nearly $40 million in his house.\n\nAs a former regulator charged with helping large Chinese companies deal with their debt, Lai was instead found to be running Huarong in a \u201cblind and disorderly way,\u201d Chinese authorities said.\n\nSince 2015, when a devastating stock market crash sparked outrage among the middle class, Communist Party leaders have viewed the financial markets as an Achilles\u2019 heel for its grip on power, observers say.\n\nLai\u2019s downfall represents more than just another corruption case.\n\n\n\nChen Shulong, former vice governor of China\u2019s Anhui province, stands trial for bribery. He pleaded guilty to taking bribes and causing financial loss of 2.91 billion yuan ($425.7 million). (AP)\n\nThe well-connected Politburo member Sun Zhengcai was sentenced in May to life in prison for taking more than $26 million in bribes. (AP)\n\nIt points to how Chinese leaders are increasingly using their disciplinary apparatus to enforce government policy, said Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing.\n\nThat\u2019s an evolution from five years ago, when Xi was clearing out rival factions in the Politburo and sensitive institutions, such as the military, Wu said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the financial industry is the focus of the anti-corruption campaign,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt\u2019s in line with the government\u2019s economic policies such as \u2018de-bubbling\u2019 and stabilizing the finance sector.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Xi\u2019s work to cement his grip on the police and military, the two instruments of hard power, also appears unfinished.\n\n[China\u2019s biggest celebrity fined $130 million for fiscal irregularities]\n\nMeng Hongwei, a deputy minister of public security and the head of Interpol, was detained this month by anti-corruption officials during a visit to Beijing. His disappearance occurred amid speculation of internal infighting.\n\nAnd two top officers in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, including former chief of joint staff Fang Fenghui, were expelled from the party last week.\n\nFang was found guilty of accepting bribes and political disloyalty. The other general, Zhang Yang, was stripped of his rank and Communist Party membership, said a statement, which added that he tried to \u201cescape punishment by committing suicide\u201d last November.\n\nMore than 300 officers were swept up as part of the investigation into the two generals, the South China Morning Post reported, citing sources close to the military.\n\nThis year, Xi expanded the leadership\u2019s reach by forming a National Supervisory Commission with sweeping powers to investigate not only Communist Party members but also state-owned companies, hospitals, schools and even sports teams.\n\n\u201cOnce you establish and empower agencies to investigate, they will inevitably find more and more people to lock up,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a retired professor of political science at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cEventually, it hurts the party\u2019s prestige and the public confidence in it.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Communist Party has signaled that it\u2019s just fine with the cycle of purges and investigations becoming the new normal of Chinese governance.\n\nSince the campaign kicked into gear, the state broadcaster has released a documentary about a never-ending corruption fight titled \u201cAlways on the Road\u201d and a slick TV drama that got huge ratings.\n\nTypically tight-lipped government authorities have been happy to drip-feed details of greed and fecklessness to the media, rallying the public around the anti-corruption campaign.\n\nThey\u2019ve disclosed the number of bill-counting machines it took to count one rogue energy official\u2019s cash pile (16, four of which broke down) and the logistics required to confiscate all the gold, antiques and cash belonging to a crooked former army commander (10 military trucks). It\u2019s not uncommon to see reports surface about the tonnage of a particular fallen official\u2019s cash hoard.\n\nJude Blanchette, a China expert at the Crumpton Group, said the never-ending corruption crusade is a distraction for Xi, but it also serves to keep the Communist Party \u2014 and vast swaths of Chinese society \u2014 in a permanent state of tension and under his sway.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has been a remarkably effective tool to help him consolidate and hold power,\u201d Blanchette said. \u201cIt\u2019s flexible enough to allow him to essentially go after anyone, with Damocles\u2019 sword hanging over almost everyone.

Japanese companies pulled out of China in droves, and the two leaders had a famously awkward encounter at an APEC meeting.\n\nBut over the past year, the two countries have started to repair their relationship, at least superficially.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign minister and premier have both visited Japan this year, and the number of Chinese tourists following suit is expected to reach a record 8 million this year. Japan was the top destination for Chinese travelers during this month\u2019s Golden Week holiday, according to travel website C-Trip.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Trump factor.\n\nChina is eagerly trying to improve economic relations with a raft of rich countries to try to reduce its exposure to the United States, where President Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports and is threatening more.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang just came back from a trip touring Chinese market access to European companies, while Beijing is redoubling its efforts to forge a trade deal called Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. There are even murmurs that China might try to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 11-country trade deal that Trump pulled out of in his first week in office.\n\nJapan, a neighbor and China\u2019s second biggest export market after the United States, is an important part of this diversification effort.\n\nChina has been pressing Japanese companies to announce investment plans and deals in China during Abe\u2019s visit, and has generally been pushing for an improvement in the relationship to offset the sharp deterioration with the United States, according to people familiar with the preparations.\n\nThis appears to be a tactical move, analysts in Tokyo say.\n\n\u201cIs it fundamental and long-lasting? It could just be a tactical move to deflect tensions coming from the U.S., and drive a wedge between the U.S. and Japan,\u201d said Narushige Michishita of Japan\u2019s National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.\n\n[Japan\u2019s Abe stakes out new identity in region: Stronger leadership and wider military reach ]\n\nBut Abe\u2019s government is happy to go along with it for its own economic reasons. \u201cPrime Minister Abe wishes to elevate Japan-China relations to a new level,\u201d a Japanese government official said, asking for anonymity to preview the sensitive visit.\n\nChina is already Japan\u2019s largest trading partner and more than 30,000 Japanese companies operate here, pumping more than $3.3 billion in direct investment into the country each year \u2014 and the market is only becoming more attractive.\n\nChina\u2019s middle class now totals about 250 million people, double the entire population of Japan. That represents a tantalizing opportunity for consumer goods companies in particular, like Shiseido, the skin care company.\n\nBut Japan is now walking a tricky balancing act. Abe has poured an enormous amount of energy into developing a personal connection with Trump, and the military alliance with the United States is the cornerstone of Japan\u2019s security.\n\nJapan is also concerned about becoming collateral damage in the trade war. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see this U.S.-China trade issue to damage the international supply chain,\u201d the Japanese official said. \u201cJapanese companies also have stakes and could be negatively affected. We hope that dialogue between the U.S. and China will lead to a diplomatic resolution of these issues.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Global Times nationalist tabloid made it clear that Abe should pay attention to how he balances his competing interests.\n\nJapan and China could help stabilize not just Asia but the whole world, columnist Sun Xiaobo wrote. He didn\u2019t mince his words when advising Japan to pick sides. \u201cJapan should have a clear idea of how to deal with U.S. influence in developing its relations with China,\u201d he wrote.\n\n[China tells Trump administration to stop its \u2018misguided\u2019 actions and allegations ]\n\nBut Beijing knows where Japan\u2019s loyalties lie, said Zhou Yongsheng, a Japan expert at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing.\n\n\u201cJapan is still an ally of the U.S. and it will avoid adopting any policies that could undermine U.S. policies,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we could expect ties to improve but the steps will not be huge.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the American factor, there is a limit to how much better relations can get. There are still plenty of historical issues causing frictions between the two countries.\n\nAbe is hellbent on revising the pacifist constitution imposed on Japan after World War II and returning the country to a normal footing with a full-fledged military, not just \u201cself-defense forces.\u201d But Beijing sees this as a sign of aggression and has strongly protested Abe\u2019s efforts to date.\n\nThere are also the continued skirmishes over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, which Japan controls but China claims.\n\n\u201cI think that China understands that there is a ceiling to how good this relationship can get, but right now for both Japan and China, they realize that it\u2019s in their interests to cooperate,\u201d said Sun of Stimson.\n\nIndeed, all is not forgotten. Abe was initially supposed to arrive in Beijing on Oct. 23, the same day 40 years before than Deng had arrived in Tokyo. But then the Chinese government realized that another anniversary fell on Oct. 23, said author Bill Bishop, editor of the Sinocism China newsletter. That is the 150th anniversary of Japan\u2019s Meiji Restoration, the day of the creation of the Japanese government that rampaged through Asia, including in China.\n\nSome anniversaries, it seems, are better left unmarked.\n\nDenyer reported from Tokyo.

Rob Manning, said later that the fatality in Herat was not an American. He declined to say whether any of the wounded were U.S. troops and referred further questions to the NATO mission in Afghanistan.\n\nQari Yusuf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Taliban insurgent movement, said in a statement Monday evening that the assailant in Herat was a Taliban \u201cinfiltrator.\u201d\n\nThe incident came four days after two top Afghan security officials in southern Kandahar province were shot dead by a member of the provincial governor\u2019s security guard team.\n\n[U.S. commander in Afghanistan survives deadly attack at governor\u2019s compound that kills top Afghan police general]\n\nThe top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, escaped unhurt in the attack, which claimed the life of Afghan National Police Gen. Abdul Raziq, a fierce anti-insurgent fighter who was considered the most powerful man in southern Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault Thursday in the compound of the Kandahar provincial governor.\n\nThe shooting by a lone attacker targeted a high-level meeting in Kandahar between U.S. and Afghan officials on plans to secure nationwide parliamentary elections Saturday.\n\nThree Americans were injured with gunshot wounds in the Kandahar attack, including Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey D. Smiley, according to four people with knowledge of the incident. Military officials have not identified the wounded, describing them only as a U.S. service member, a contractor who is part of the military coalition and a civilian.\n\nSmiley has commanded the U.S. military assistance mission in southern Afghanistan since August, according to his National Guard biography.\n\nAfter the Kandahar attack, some Afghans, including several national legislators, questioned the official version of the incident. Conspiracy theorists charged that the U.S. military was behind a plot to kill Abdul Raziq, a powerful regional security boss who was sometimes difficult for Afghanistan\u2019s civilian government to control.\n\nThose alleging a foreign plot questioned why Miller escaped unharmed while senior Afghans in the same meeting died, and why U.S. military officials stressed strongly that Miller was not the target of the attack. Taliban spokesmen said Miller, Abdul Raziq and other Afghan officials were all targets.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah, dismissed such rumors Monday after a meeting with Miller. He said people who spread them are just \u201chelping the enemy.\u201d\n\nThe head of the country\u2019s intelligence service, Masoom Stanikzai, also rejected the allegations. Speaking to journalists in Kandahar, he gave a detailed account of the attack. He said the lone shooter, who was killed in the encounter, gave a false name when he enrolled recently in the provincial security service. He added that 15 other people have been arrested in the plot.\n\nStanikzai said that 15 minutes before the attack Thursday, the plotters received a phone call from \u201cacross the border,\u201d meaning Pakistan, giving them instructions. \u201cIt is clear that the enemies of Afghanistan planned this plot on the other side of the border\u201d and worked hard on it, he said.\n\nInsider attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan became a significant concern beginning in 2008. Since then, more than 100 incidents have been reported in which U.S. or coalition troops or contractors have been killed or wounded by Afghans in uniform. The death toll in those incidents stands at about 155, with 200 injured. The incidents peaked in 2012, then declined steadily as foreign forces withdrew and new protection and vetting measures were adopted.\n\nHowever, several deadly assaults on U.S. forces in the past several years came at the hands of highly trained Afghan commandos. This has raised alarm, since such troops work closely with U.S. counterterrorism forces and are considered the best-trained and motivated of all Afghan security personnel.\n\nIn June of last year, an Afghan special operations forces commando opened fire on American troops, killing three and wounding one, at a firebase in the Achin district of Nangahar province. The victims were members of the U.S. Special Operations forces assisting Afghan forces on a joint anti-terrorism mission against the Islamic State.\n\nOne week later, an Afghan army soldier opened fire at a joint Afghan and U.S. military and training base in northern Afghanistan. One Afghan soldier was killed and seven Americans were wounded. NATO and U.S. officials said the attacker was shot and died on the way to a hospital. No foreigners died in that attack. Afghan officials confirmed that the shooter was an Afghan soldier; one said he was an army commando.\n\nDan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/22/despair-heart-afghanistans-election/", "published": "2018-10-22T17:59:57", "title": "The despair at the heart of Afghanistan\u2019s election", "text": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

It was the first vote held largely independent of foreign assistance since the Taliban fell in 2001. As Afghan President Ashraf Ghani put it, shortly after casting his ballot at a Kabul elementary school, the high turnout proved voters \u201chave the power and will to defeat their enemies,\u201d namely the Taliban and the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cToday, we proved together we will uphold democracy, casting ballots without fear,\u201d he said.\n\nI just voted. And I thank the ANDSF, the IEC staff, and the great people of #Afghanistan who made it possible to vote despite the risks involved. Today we proved together that we uphold democracy. With casting our ballots without fear we honor the sacrifices of the fallen. pic.twitter.com/wrUCEa0MCR \u2014 Ashraf Ghani (@ashrafghani) October 20, 2018\n\nBut if Ghani seemed optimistic, his countrymen are not. \u201cIn the past 17 years of war and crisis in Afghanistan,\u201d the New York Times wrote, \u201cno one remembers a season quite like this one, with peril and hopelessness at every turn.\u201d The campaign was marred by gruesome violence. Sectarian strife and political division threaten to tear the battered country apart. And few people believe Ghani can pick up the pieces.\n\nIt didn\u2019t have to be that way. In June, Ghani announced a temporary cease-fire with the Taliban. Experts hoped that the pause, backed by NATO and the United States, would pave the way for peace talks with the fundamentalist group, which has been gaining ground in its years-long battle to recapture the country. Military analysts say as many as 100 Afghans are dying each day in skirmishes between the Taliban and security forces; they say 61 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s districts are controlled by the Taliban.\n\nBut the cease-fire was called off just weeks later, after the Taliban staged major attacks in the cities of Kunduz and Ghazni. By the time campaigning began in earnest this fall, election-related violence was a near-daily occurrence.\n\nAs my colleague Pamela Constable wrote, \u201cthe Taliban, which had promised to disrupt the vote, claimed to have staged 164 attacks nationwide Saturday. In the days leading up to the poll, insurgents assassinated a top security official in Kandahar province, leading authorities to postpone the election there for one week at least. In other provinces, 10 candidates were killed during the campaign.\u201d\n\nJust this weekend, officials estimate, 78 people, including 28 members of Afghan security forces, were killed at polling places. In Kabul, there were as many as a dozen attacks, including a suicide bomber who killed 10 voters and five police officers when he detonated his explosive outside a police station. A third of all polling stations stayed closed because the government could not guarantee the safety of voters.\n\nThe violence has made the question of who wins the election almost a secondary concern. Experts largely agree that there is no peaceful future for Afghanistan without achieving a political reconciliation with the Taliban. But the group has shown no interest in moderating its stances \u2014 and its campaign of terror against Afghan democracy makes any compromise seem all but impossible.\n\n\n\nAn Afghan police officer stands at the scene of a suicide bomb attack at a voter-registration center in Kabul on April 22. (Hedayatullah Amid/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBeyond the slim hopes for peace, there is a deep anxiety about the government\u2019s ability to protect and lead its citizens. An Asia Society poll, conducted annually since 2006, found that public support for democracy and key institutions in Afghanistan is dropping. Less than half the population trusts the country\u2019s Independent Election Commission, and confidence in members of parliament is falling.\n\nIn the run-up to this weekend\u2019s vote, that skepticism was on full display. Fear of corruption and voter fraud was rampant, prompting the government to launch a last-minute, high-tech anti-fraud program. But on election weekend, many poll workers were unable to use the equipment meant to verify voters' identities. As a result, polling centers opened late, and lines moved slowly, though election officials say delays affected fewer than 10 percent of polling centers.\n\nStill, about 4 million of Afghanistan\u2019s 8.8 million registered voters turned out \u2014 a striking number when you consider the deadly risks voters faced in showing up at all. Many who came out did so because they want an opportunity to control their future. Zamir Ahmad Khaksar of Jalalabad, a city that has been targeted by repeated bombings, told the New York Times on Sunday that he had been waiting for an hour at a polling place for election workers to find his voter registration. They had yet to find it, he said, but he was undeterred: \u201cI would come to vote even if bullets were raining in the city just to have a proper parliament.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, offered a darker vision. There is no returning to normal in Afghanistan, they said, and their only hope is that the country\u2019s deep dysfunction will give way to something totally new and possibly better.\n\n\u201cWe had a fake economy, fake money and fake prosperity. Security was provided by foreigners. Our role, our input, our understanding was limited,\u201d Mirwais Arya, an entrepreneur in Kabul, told the Times. \u201cMy sense is that the situation will get worse as that fakeness crumbles, that we will reach the edge of collapse before there is a move for the better. \u2026 But once it crumbles, we will see that underneath, the society has actually transformed.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?
